# KaggleXProject 
# Streamlining Life Insurance Applications with Predictive Modeling

This repository contains a Python application that uses an XGBoost classifier to make predictions based on a CSV dataset. The application is designed to run on your local machine and use it for making predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this application, you'll need to have the following installed on your local machine:

- Python (version 3.8 or later)
- Anaconda or virtual environment for managing Python packages
- XGBoost (Python package)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for exploring the model)

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
git clone https://github.com/phyllisgitu/KaggleXProject.git
cd KaggleXProject
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

Then, you can access the web application at
   http://127.0.0.1:8080/
